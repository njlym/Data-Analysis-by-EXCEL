# Data-Analysis-by-EXCEL
This repository contains the Excel file, report and the presentation for the final project for the Data Analysis using Excel Bootcamp, which involves solving five key questions using various Excel functionalities.
The project demonstrates skills in data cleaning, table creation, pivot table generation, VBA macro development, chart creation, and statistical analysis.

## Project Details

### Question 1: Mathematical Functions

- **Tasks**:
  - Converted data into a table and added an incremental ID column.
  - Calculated profit using the formula `=H2-G2`.
  - Used AVERAGE and AVERAGEIF functions to find average cost and sales.
  - Determined the number of days between the first and last orders using `=MAX(B:B)-MIN(B:B)`.

### Question 2: Conditional Statements and Pivot Tables

- **Tasks**:
  - Used the IF function to standardize gender data.
  - Created three pivot tables:
    1. Overall job count distribution across various majors and employment statuses.
    2. Count of degrees across various majors.
    3. Count of English grades.

### Question 3: VBA & Macros

- **Tasks**:
  - Developed a VBA macro to:
    - Generate random numbers.
    - Calculate squares of the numbers.
    - Determine if the numbers are odd or even.
  - Added a button to execute the macro.

### Question 4: Charts and Dashboard

- **Tasks**:
  - Created a pivot table and charts to visualize data.
  - Developed a dashboard to display these charts.
  - Added slicers to filter data dynamically.

### Question 5: Regression Model

- **Tasks**:
  - Created a scatter plot to analyze the correlation between distance traveled and calories burned.
  - Used the CORREL function to find the correlation coefficient.
  - Built a regression model using Excelâ€™s Data Analysis Toolpak.
